# Security Turret

A prototype for a small home, industrial or military safety setup. Uses face recognition to determine the identity of anyone who enters a region. If the intruder does not leave, force will be applied. Created by Victor Wang, Patrick Wang, Willard Ma and Kevin Gu.

The pySerial library(python) was used to interface between python and the Arduino serial. The Servo library(Arduino) was used to communicate with the servo motors. All of this was done in real time.
