# Security Turret

A prototype for a small home, industrial or military safety setup. Uses face recognition to determine the identity of anyone who enters a region. If the intruder does not leave, force will be applied.

The pySerial library(python) was used to interface between python and the Arduino serial
The Servo library(Arduino) was used to communicate with the servo motors 
All of this was done in real time
